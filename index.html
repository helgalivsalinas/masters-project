				<h2>What is the DREAM Act and where are we now?</h2>
			</div>

			<p>The DREAM Act is a federal law that, if approved, will allow undocumented youth to live and work in the United States legally, ultimately putting them on a path to citizenship.</p>

			<p>In different forms and under different names, the DREAM Act has been around since 2001 when the life story of  Tereza Lee--a high school student who faced the prospect of not being able to go to college because she was in the country illegally--found its way to the chambers of Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Springfield, Illinois, who was first elected to the Senate in 1996 and remains there today as Assistant Majority Leader.</p>

			<p>The immigration story of the Lee family began when her parents, separately, left South Korea in 1976 for Paraguay, where they met. Then they moved to Brazil, where Tereza was born in 1983. When she was two years old, the family decided to start over again in the United States. Her mother sold her wedding ring for $2000 to pay for their plane tickets and their visas. They moved into a basement in the north side of Chicago, and, when their visitor’s visas expired, they simply stayed. They had entered a gray area: undocumented in America.</p>

			<p>Lee and her family dealt with the undocumented status by working hard and staying out of prying eyes, including those of the police and others who could have helped them in their transition to the U.S. Lee’s parents worked at a dry cleaner’s in exchange for cheap rent for their basement apartment. “It would flood every time it rained. We would have hammocks and sleep above the water,” remembered Lee, now 30, during an  interview in March in New York. “Days we went without food.”</p>


			<p>She depended on the free breakfast at her public school and picked food out from the trash to eat. “We were not living in modern America,” said Lee. Afraid of being caught and deported, they “stayed still” anytime a police car passed by. Lee feared the most, that if deported, she would return to Brazil, her country of birth, while her parents would be sent to Korea, leaving her U.S. born brother behind.</p>
			
			<p>However, “I thought I was American like all the other kids,” she said. Every morning at school, she put her right hand over her heart and pledged allegiance to the flag, a story she told Senator Durbin when they met in September 2000.</p>

			<p>As a pastor, her father tried in vain to obtain a religious worker visa. At 7, she began learning how to play piano in order to perform in church, and quickly learned that she had a special talent for the instrument. When Lee was 15,  her brother was  hit by a car and the police came. The driver was on the cell phone, but the family didn’t want to file a report to avoid attention to their status. It was then that Lee realized  “something was wrong with us being undocumented. I decided to do something to help my family,” she said.</p>
 
			<p>This meant becoming a pianist. She found out that the Merit School of Music gave scholarships, which she won and was able to attend during her last two years of high school. She won several competitions and got the chance to play with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Then, she was paid to play at concerts.</p>

			<p>Merit School of Music Director Ann Monaco asked which colleges Lee, by then 17, was applying to. When Lee said that she wasn’t going to college, Monaco’s reaction was to give Lee the application forms to fill out.</p>

			<p>When she brought back the forms to Monaco, she saw that the Social Security Number box was empty. Lee burst into tears and told Monaco that she and her parents were undocumented. “Please don’t tell the police,” Lee remembered telling her. “She was the first person I ever told.”</p>

			<p>Rather than call the authorities, Monaco was mobilized into action. First, she tried to adopt Lee, but Lee had just turned 18, an adult and ineligible. So, she asked Lee, “Do you trust me?” Lee nodded. Monaco decided to contact Senator Durbin.</p> 

			<p>Sen. Durbin called the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) about Lee’s situation (without revealing her name), and realized that the law said that she had to be deported, a story he told at the first-ever Senate hearing of the DREAM Act in June 2011.<sup><a href="#footnote-dream-1">1</a></sup></p>

			<p>“I was contacted by Ann Monaco, a teacher at the Merit School of Music in Chicago. One of her students, Tereza, was an extraordinary musical talent who had played as a soloist in the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. She had been accepted of some the country’s most prestigious music schools,” said Sen. Durbin at the hearing. “So we contacted the INS [Immigration and Naturalization Service, which no longer exists under that name]<sup><a href="#footnote-dream-2">2</a></sup> and they told us that she had an option. Tereza would have to leave the United States for ten years, and that’s when I started to work on the DREAM Act. Tereza, you got me started.”</p>

			<p>Inspired by her story, and hearing from others in similar situations,<sup><a href="#footnote-dream-3">3</a></sup> he began to draft a bill to help undocumented youth to have a path to citizenship, which he initially called the Children's Adjustment, Relief, and Education (CARE) Act (S1265).<sup><a href="#footnote-dream-4">4</a></sup</p>

			<p>That morphed into the first version of what came to be known as the DREAM Act (Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act) (S.1291),<sup><a href="#footnote-dream-5">5</a></sup> co-sponsored with Senator Orrin Hatch (R.) from Utah. They introduced it in the Senate in August 2001.</p>

			<p>The name was inspired by a recurring theme in the stories of undocumented students who hoped to achieve the American Dream through their studies.</p>

			<p>A Senate hearing was scheduled for September 12, 2001.</p>

			<p>“This was gonna pass,” said Lee. They were all confident. Lee was ready to attend, to “awe them” with her piano performance at the DREAM Act’s Senate hearing that was scheduled for September 12, 2001. But the hearing was cancelled after the attacks of 9/11. It was rescheduled, and they waited to hear back for months.</p>
			 
			<p>“No one knew what was going on,” Lee said.</p>

			<p>The attacks of 9/11 sparked an anti-immigrant sentiment across the country. The sentiments were hardened by the economic crisis that began in 2007, and immigrants became the scapegoats of a nation frustrated by a faltering economy and fearful of outsiders.</p>

			<p>Lee began to lose hope in the passage of the DREAM Act. “I thought I should deport myself to Brazil,” said Lee. She began to teach herself Portuguese.</p>

			<p>But the bill sponsors did not give up, introducing it at various times and with various changes to accommodate the feelings of members of Congress who either thought the bill was too forgiving or too restrictive. It was reintroduced in 2003 (S1545), 2005 (S2075), 2007 (S774  and S2205), 2009 (S729), 2010 (S3992 and S3962), and 2011 (S952).<sup><a href="#footnote-dream-6">6</a></sup></p>

			<p>After 9/11, DREAM Act eligibility included not only those who were enrolled at a university but also those who had enlisted in the army.<sup><a href="#footnote-extra">*</a></sup> Only in 2007 and 2010 did the bill make it to a Senate vote, both times falling short of enough votes to overcome filibusters.</p>

			<p>Lee, now 30, married an American citizen in April 2005, and became a citizen five years later. But she scoffed at the piece of paper that said, “Welcome to the United States,” to which she replied, “I’ve been here all my life!” </p>

			<p>When her U.S. born brother turned 21, he applied on behalf of their mom to get a green card, or residency status, which she has now. Her father died five years ago.</p>

			<p>Lee is now working on her doctorate at Manhattan School of Music and lives in New York City. She was able to attend because she was rewarded a full scholarship after Monaco talked to the administration, explaining that Lee had a bill in Congress to amend her situation. On her college forms, her status was listed to be “in process.”</p> 

			<p>She continues to speak publicly in support of the DREAM Act, and performed at a benefit to help DREAM Act eligible youth go to college at a university in Chicago in April.</p>

			<h3>State of Undocumented Students</h3>

			<p>Inspired by the DREAM Act, some states have recently passed laws that favor undocumented students, easing their way through college by allowing them to pay in-state tuition and applying for state financial aid, which makes it possible for many undocumented immigrants to  attend college.</p>

			<p>The most recent implementation of such legislation was in California this past January. Other states that have passed such laws include New York, Maryland, Connecticut, Utah, Texas, Washington, Illinois, Kansas, New Mexico, Nebraska, and Wisconsin.<sup><a href="#footnote-dream-7">7</a></sup></p> 

			<p>In June 2012, President Obama announced that he would stop the deportation of DREAM Act eligible youth. Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) was put in place in August 2012. Deferred action already existed as an informal way to defer deportation, but with DACA, President Obama made a formal procedure available to many.<sup><a href="#footnote-dream-8">8</a></sup></p>

			</div>

			<p>Those who are eligible receive a deferment of deportation. They also obtain an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) card to be legally allowed to work. In some states, this leads to the ability to get a driver’s license. To get the deferment, the applicant must be under 31 years of age, must have come to the U.S. before the age of 16 and resided in the U.S. continuously since then. They also must be enrolled in school, or be an honorably discharged veteran.<sup><a href="#footnote-dream-9">9</a></sup> They must have never been convicted of a felony.</p> 

			<p>It has been reported that more 150,000 applicants have been able to obtain deferred action.<sup><a href="#footnote-dream-10">10</a></sup> It lasts for two years. What happens after the two years, it’s still unclear.</p>

			<p>Obama has stated that immigration reform is a priority this year, focusing on stopping the deportation of DREAM Act eligible youth. Yet, “Dreamers” worry that the law does not protect their parents or other loved ones. Already, the Obama administration has deported 1.5 million immigrants,<sup><a href="#footnote-dream-11">11</a></sup> a record, 23% of which were parents of U.S. citizen children.<sup><a href="#footnote-dream-12">12</a></sup></p>

			<p>Now, undocumented youth activists have changed the tone and substance of their demands. They want a clear path to citizenship, for not only themselves, but for their families. For all 11 million.</p>

			<div id="who">
				<h2>Who are the DREAMers?</h2>
			</div>

			<p>DREAMer: an undocumented youth who was brought to the U.S. at a young age, likely to benefit from the Dream Act to achieve citizenship. Recently, it has been used to describe anyone who aspires to be a U.S. citizen, and not just youth.</p>

			<p>DREAMers are also activists, young men and women who have come out of the shadows of their undocumented status to put a face to their demands for a comprehensive path to citizenship in the United States, the only country most of them have ever known, and the only country they claim as their own.</p>

			<p>There are 11.1 million<sup><a href="#footnote-who-1">13</a></sup> undocumented people in the U.S. Of that group, 4.4 million are undocumented immigrants who are aged 30 or younger. There are 1.7 million DREAMer eligible youth.<sup><a href="#footnote-who-2">14</a></sup> More than half of undocumented immigrants are from Mexico and Central America, followed by South America and the Caribbean, and Asia.<sup><a href="#footnote-who-3">15</a></sup></p>

			<div id="history">
				<h2>What is the history of the movement?</h2>
			</div>

			<p>When Tereza Lee told her story to Monaco and, later, to Sen. Durbin, the limitations that  her lack of immigration status imposed on her life were shocking to most people who didn’t know such a talented, high achieving student who spoke English could not go on to college. How could she be considered “illegal”?</p>

			<div id="image">		
				<img src="images/js_criminal.jpg" tite="Criminalizing immigration" width="400">

			</div>

			<p>People like Lee are often saddled with the label “illegal immigrants,” which tends to criminalize the person, not the act of getting into the country--or arriving in it--illegally. It is a label that distances the immigrants from the rest of the country, suggesting that they have homes elsewhere and came with the intention to break the law and to infringe on other people’s rights.</p>

			<p>Sen. Durbin’s bill came at a time when a growing number of undocumented youth were graduating from high school and setting their sights in college a decade ago. Their predicament, coupled with the existence of the bill, gave birth to a movement that began, simply enough, with the stories of people like Gaby Pacheco, an immigrant from Ecuador, and Julio Salgado, an immigrant from Mexico.</p> 

			<p>On different coasts-–Pacheco in Florida and Salgado in California--and with different styles--Pacheco using tactics from the Civil Rights movement and Salgado through his art--they were two of the most visible DREAMers to put a face and a powerful personal narrative at the service of a national crusade involving 11 million undocumented immigrants.</p>

			<h3>Gaby Pacheco</h3>

			<p>Like Lee and so many others, when Pacheco and her family came to the United States in 1993, they overstayed their visas. She was eight years old.</p>

			<p>“I didn’t know I was moving from one country to another,” said Pacheco in a phone interview. “I thought Ecuador was the whole world.”</p>

			<p>As she was finishing middle school and beginning high school, Pacheco saw her siblings unable to pursue higher education and professions. She remembers her sisters being told that they couldn’t attend college because of their status.<sup><a href="#footnote-history-1">16</a></sup></p>

			<p>“Their dreams weren’t able to come true...that really scared me,” said Pacheco. “I went on overdrive. Only in school can we learn. I became a super nerd.” She challenged herself to take “the hardest classes.”</p>

			<p>In high school, she began telling others about her status.</p>

			<p>“In my mind, we couldn’t be the only ones,” she said, and remembers that, after her disclosure, some of her fellow peers would respond, “Gaby, I have a secret to tell you. I’m undocumented, like you.”</p>

			<p>Emboldened by the stories of her peers and her own predicament, Pacheco began to see the pursuit of higher education as a human right. </p>

			<p>“I wasn’t going to stop to make sure other people didn’t have to go through the things that I did.”</p>

			<p>She began attending Miami Dade College with a student’s visa, paying tuition as an international student, and eventually becoming student government president.</p>

			</div>

			<p>Then a friend who had traveled to California came up to her and told her about Sen. Durbin’s bill. That was when Pacheco learned about the DREAM Act, and became an expert on it.</p>

			<p>Then in July 2006, ICE agents knocked on her door.<sup><a href="#footnote-history-2">17</a></sup> “Kinda scary. It happened early in the morning,” said Pacheco. At the time Pacheco still had her student visa, so she wasn’t detained, but her sisters and her parents were.</p>

			<p>“[It was] something I had to deal with. [By] bringing attention to myself, [I felt] guilt. I had just put my family in danger because of activism,” said Pacheco. “Deport me, whatever, but I never thought they came after my family.”</p>

			<p>In 2009, youth activists realized that President Obama had actually deported more people than the Bush administration. It made it all the more apparent that being undocumented was a label and a category that divided and disenfranchised, no matter who was in the White House. It was the law. Incensed by the detainment and deportation of undocumented immigrants and youth, Juan Rodriguez, who had come to the US when he was six, was inspired to march to Washington, D.C. At 20, he did and invited Pacheco to come along.</p>

			<p>“We wanted to recreate the underground railroad to tell our story,” said Pacheco, who by then had met other students, like her, through the Florida Immigration Coalition. “We wanted real change.”</p>

			<p>On January 1, 2010, Pacheco walked in a march called the Trail of Dreams,<sup><a href="#footnote-history-7">18</a></sup> a 1,500-mile trek from Miami to D.C., along with three other undocumented students, Felipe Matos, Carlos Roa, and Juan Rodriguez. She remembers that people called them “walkers,” but she preferred the word DREAMers. “That caught on like fire,” she said.</p>

			<p>The label “DREAMers” tied the knot between the DREAM Act and the undocumented students. Like Pacheco had realized before, it brought education as a human right to the forefront of the movement. The word “Dream” even carries the legacy of the quote every American school kid learns: Martin Luther King’s “I have a Dream” speech.</p>

			</div>

			<p>When the march began, Pacheco still had her student visa. By the time the march ended on May 1, it had expired.</p> 

			<p>Then, in March 2010, the Immigrant Youth Justice League (IYJL) organized a rally in Chicago where 1000 people marched<sup><a href="#footnote-history-3">19</a></sup> and a group of eight young people openly admitted their status.<sup><a href="#footnote-history-4">20</a></sup> The League was co-founded by undocumented student Rigo Padilla<sup><a href="#footnote-history-5">21</a></sup> who had fought off deportation in 2009. The rally paved the way for undocumented students to begin to “come out of the shadows.”<sup><a href="#footnote-history-6">22</a></sup></p>

			<p>“It was so beautiful,” said Pacheco, who was surprised and touched when she saw so many young people unafraid to announce publicly their status.</p> 

			<p>Since then, Pacheco has been telling her story publicly, pushing for the passage of the DREAM Act.<sup><a href="#footnote-history-8">23</a></sup> However, she believes  that other undocumented students should lead the rallies and tell their stories. At 29 now,  she does “behind the scenes” work, which includes shaping current demand for comprehensive immigration reform for everyone, not just youth.</p>

			<p>”It makes no sense for our parents to be deported and we stay here,” she said.</p>

			<h3>Julio Salgado</h3>

			<div id="image">		
				<img src="images/js_iexist.jpg" tite="I Exist" width="400">

			</div>

			<p>Julio Salgado, 29, creates colorful art that shows the faces and explains the stories of undocumented students. His work is bright and graffiti-like, as if it came from the murals of the streets of LA.</p>

			<p>Salgado, founder of DREAMers Adrift,<sup><a href="#footnote-history-9">24</a></sup> calls himself an undocuqueer artist. “Undocuqueer,” a term adopted to those who are both gay and undocumented.</p>

			<p>He came  from Mexico with his parents when he was 11. His younger sister needed medical care, resulting in receiving a kidney transplant from her mother.  Doctors told them if they left the U.S. that his sister would die, Salgado said.<sup><a href="#footnote-history-10">25</a></sup></p>

			<p>“We stayed in here in 1995 and been here ever since,” said Salgado. His parents hoped they would return to Mexico, but with his sister in and out of the hospital, their passports eventually expired. His parents asked lawyers about their status, but were told that they had to leave the country in order to apply for visa to come back. And so they just continued to stay.</p> 

			<p>Then, in 1996, an immigration law practically trapped them here. Anyone who was in the country illegally and left could not come back for at least 10 years.<sup><a href="#footnote-history-11">26</a></sup></p>

			<p>Salgado always knew he was undocumented, but it wasn’t until high school that he realized the obstacles that came with it. “I found out how hard it was gonna be without papers,” said Salgado.</p>

			<p>In 9th grade, he was offered a job by a teacher to be an aide. “It paid $10 an hour. For a 9th grader, I could help my parents,” said Salgado. His teacher told him that he needed his parent’s permission and his social security number. So he asked his dad, “I need a social, where do I get one?” To which his dad replied, “Your passport expired, so you can’t get one.”</p>

			<p>When he told his teacher that he was undocumented, she became the first person outside of his family to learn the truth. That was when he realized that “not everyone is against me.” That summer, instead of working as an aide, he cleaned houses with his mom and then he worked at a swamp meet.</p>

			<p>In 2001, he graduated high school and started community college that summer. “I just wanted to go to school,” said Salgado. So he started researching scholarships and began to attend Long Beach Community College. It wasn’t until his mother suggested in 2003 that he go to a panel at a college fair that he thought of attending a 4-year university as a possibility. There, a girl talked about being undocumented and attending UCLA. That’s when he first learned about the DREAM Act.</p>


			<p>He transferred out of community college to attend Calfiornia State University, Long Beach. In Spring 2007, he helped start an student organization called FUEL (Future Underrepresented Educated Leaders) for undocumented students.</p> 

			<p>“It was very hush-hush,” said Salgado. He would describe it as an AB540 group, so that undocumented students understood it was for them. In California, AB540<sup><a href="#footnote-history-12">27</a></sup> allows undocumented students to pay in-state tuition at state universities.</p>

			<p>Salgado took Chicano Studies classes and was introduced to Chicana feminist artists like Alma Lopez and Favianna Rodriguez. “I wanna do that,” said Salgado about their art. “How can I do that as an undocumented person? It was another type of activism. Tell my story and other students through art.”</p>

			<p>He began to use art to combat negative portrayals of immigrants. “Media calling us illegal, using this word, dehumanizing us. I really wanted to use art to take power away from that word,” said Salgado.</p>

			<p>It inspired the words “I Exist!” in his artwork.<sup><a href="#footnote-history-13">28</a></sup> “I felt that other people weren’t gonna empower me. It’s really messed up that some people think that humans can be illegal. Feels like this language was okay to use,” said Salgado. “I’m not illegal. I’m a human being.”</p>

			</div>

			<p>Salgado graduated from Cal State University of Long Beach and began blogging his artwork in 2010. When he shared them on Facebook, he received messages from many undocumented people who weren’t used to seen their plight reflected in art, prompting him to continue to create.</p>

			<p>He attributes the move to come out as undocumented as inspiration taken from the LGBTQ community,<sup><a href="#footnote-history-14">29</sup></a> and the belief that there is strength and safety in numbers.<sup><a href="#footnote-history-15">30</sup></a></p>

			<p>He recalls going to Long Beach City Hall in 2004 to persuade council members to pass a resolution to support the DREAM Act. He told his story and outed his status, and it was recorded.</p>

			<p>“It was one of the first times I talked. It was weird. I told people that I don’t have any papers and nothing happened,” said Salgado. “The more I was telling my story, the more people had my back.”</p>

			<p>He feels that the emerging intersectionality like “undocuqueer” only scratches the surface of the nuances of the undocumented community --nuances that even the word DREAMer doesn’t include.</p> 

			<p>“At first because of the DREAM Act--we’re all DREAMers,” said Salgado. “It almost felt I was begging people to accept me. I’m a good person, accept me. DREAMer--wanting to aspire to be perfect, to be American."</p>

			<div id="image">		
				<img src="images/js_undocuqueer.jpg" tite="Undocuqeer" width="200">

			</div>

			<p>“I really wanted to showcase these layers to us,” said Salgado. “I’m a human being. Citizen of the world. Yes, I’m undocumented. I’m more than that. I’m an artist. I’m a son. I have flaws. I’m not perfect.”</p>

			<p>In June 2012, Salgado appeared on the cover of TIME Magazine<sup><a href="#footnote-history-16">31</a></sup> along with 35 undocumented people, including Gaby Pacheco,<sup><a href="#footnote-history-17">32</a></sup> under the headline, “We Are Americans: Just not Legally.” At the forefront was Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Jose Antonio Vargas, and all around him there were immigrants from Peru, Germany, India, Korea, Armenia, Israel, Nigeria, and the Dominican Republic.</p>

			<p>The year before, Vargas had “come out” as undocumented in a piece he wrote for the New York Times.<sup><a href="#footnote-history-18">33</a></sup> He was inspired by the Trail of Dreams. “At the risk of deportation...they are speaking out,” wrote Vargas. “Their courage has inspired me.”</a></p>

			<p>In the story he chronicled his life as an undocumented person--coming to the U.S. from the Philippines at the age of 12, the false documents he used, his journalism career, and the emotional turmoil behind it all. Like Salgado, he is also gay, which truncated his family’s hopes of his becoming a citizen via marriage.</p>

			<p>He also wrote the cover story<sup><a href="#footnote-history-19">34</a></sup>  for that June 2012 issue of TIME magazine where he explained the  immigration situation of thousands of young people like him, who are fighting for a path for legalization.</p>

			<p>“I am still here. Still in limbo. So are nearly 12 million [today, the number is considerd to be 11 million] others like me,” wrote Vargas. “What exactly do you want to do with us? More important, when will you realize that we are one of you?”</p>

			<p>At 32, Vargas does not qualify for Deferred Action, but he has put a national face to the plight of undocumented students. He’s using different platforms, including social media, to tell his story and to push for comprehensive immigration reform. In the process, he and others, have made immigration a part of the national conversation, and a priority for the White House and 113th Congress of the United States.</p>

			<h3>Today</h3>

			<p>Congress has released a proposal for comprehensive immigration reform that includes the DREAM Act.</p> 

			<p>To qualify, the undocumented youth had to have arrived before the age of 15, have been present in the U.S. before December 2011, obtain a high school diploma and pursue higher education or enlist in the military, and encourages family reunification. This version also gives the opportunity for deportees to return and get on the path for citizenship. However, they had to have immigrated to the U.S. before December 2011. There is no age cap, which differs from previous versions.<sup><a href="#footnote-history-20">35</a></sup></p>

			<p>After 5 years, DREAMers will be eligible for citizenship. If approved, it would make Pacheco, Salgado, Vargas and millions more Americans in the eyes of the law. In theirs, they've been Americans for a long time.</p>
